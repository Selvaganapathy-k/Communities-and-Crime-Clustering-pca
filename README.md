# 🏘️ Communities and Crime Clustering using PCA

## 📌 Project Description

This project performs **Clustering Analysis** on the **Communities and Crime dataset** using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction.
The objective is to identify patterns and group communities based on socio-economic and crime-related attributes.

This project is developed as a **mini project** to gain practical experience in **unsupervised learning**, **PCA**, and data preprocessing techniques.
